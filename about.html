        <p>This website is a project about Triggers and Cursors in PL/SQL.</p>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">What is a Trigger?</h2>
        <p>A trigger is a procedure (code segment) that is executed automatically when some specific events occur in a table/view of a database. </p>
        <p>Among its other uses, triggers are mainly used for maintaining integrity in a database.</p>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px">What is a Cursor?</h2>
        <p>A cursor is a control structure used in databases to go through the database records. It is very similar to the iterator provided by many programming languages.</p> 
        <p>In addition to traversing through records in a database, cursors also facilitate data retrieval, adding and deleting records.</p>
        <h3>These were the two main questions answered in this project.</h3>
        <hr style="width: 80%; margin-left:200px; margin-top:10px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <p>This project and hence the website is created by Aviral Pulast, a B.TECH. first year student of VIT,Chennai as his project on Triggers and Cursors for the subject Database Management Systems. </p>
        <p>This website is made by the pure knowledge of HTMl and CSS with reference to a few online sites.</p>
