            <p>To execute SQL statements, a work area is used by the Oracle engine </p>
            <p>for its internal processing and storing the information.This work area is private to SQL’s operations.</p> 
            <p>The ‘Cursor’ is the PL/SQL construct that allows the user to name the work area and access the stored information in it.</p>

           <h3>USE OF CURSORS</h3>
            <p>The major function of a cursor is to retrieve data, one row at a time, from a result set, unlike the SQL commands which operate on all the rows in the result set at one time.</p>
            <p> Cursors are used when the user needs to update records in a singleton fashion or in a row by row manner, in a database table.</p>
            <p>The Data that is stored in the Cursor is called the Active Data Set. Oracle DBMS has another predefined area in the main memory Set, within which the cursors are opened. Hence the size of the cursor is limited by the size of this pre-defined area.</p>

                <li>FETCH: When the cursor is opened, rows can be fetched from the cursor one by one or in a block to perform data manipulation. </li>

            <h3>IMPLICIT CURSOSRS</h3>
            <p>The implicit cursors are the predefined cursor, which is associated with DML statements. They are automatically generated by oracle wherever an SQL statement is processed.</p> 
            <p>That is why they are also known as SQL cursors. </p>
            <p>The user can’t control the behavior of these cursors. The oracle server creates an implicit cursor for any SQL statement as long as there is no explicit cursor exists for that SQL statements.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">%FOUND</h3>
            <p>This returns TRUE if a DML statement like INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE affects at least one or more row.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="notfound" >
            <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">%NOTFOUND</h3>
            <P>it will return TRUE only if no statement is affected by a DML statement.</P>

        <div class="isopen">
            <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">%ISOPEN</h3>
